## Overview

In light of the surge in original film production by prominent corporations, Microsoft has sought our expertise in evaluating the prospects of the movie industry and offering guidance prior to any strategic determinations. Our assessment encompassed the utilization of return on investment as a key indicator for assessing the viability of distinct genres. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth examination of the leading studios in terms of box office success and scrutinized the most sought-after genres, as evidenced by substantial viewer ratings, in order to formulate our recommendations.

## Business Problem

Microsoft's primary concern revolves around ascertaining the viability of entering the film industry as a profitable business endeavor. Their pivotal tasks include pinpointing the specific genres of films to produce, formulating effective profit strategies, and establishing a distinctive presence that positions them as industry frontrunners.

## Data Understanding

Four distinct datasets were provided, each containing unique data. These datasets include:

Box Office Mojo Movie Gross
IMDB Title Basics
IMDB Title Ratings
The Numbers Movie Budgets
This analysis makes use of datasets obtained from three different movie websites, specifically Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, and IMDB.

The initial dataset, zippedData/bom.movie_gross.csv.gz, consists of five columns featuring movie titles, studio information, domestic and foreign financial earnings, and the release year.

The second dataset, zippedData/tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz, encompasses details about released films, encompassing their titles, release dates, and financial data such as production budgets and global earnings. The key focus in this dataset is the Return on Investment (ROI), and the financial columns take precedence in its selection.

The third and fourth datasets, zippedData/imdb.name.basics.csv.gz and zippedData/imdb.title.ratings.csv.gz, contain data on genre codes, the original language of the films, original movie titles, popularity metrics, release dates, and voting information. These datasets were used to correlate genre codes with genre names sourced from the same website, enabling the identification of trending genres.

## Recommendations
__Comprehensive Budget Considerations__: When planning your film projects, it's crucial to take into account various elements that contribute to production quality and profitability. These encompass factors such as production quality, marketing strategies, the caliber of the cast, script quality, costume design, set design, and all other aspects related to budgeting. A thorough examination of these elements will help shape a more profitable film.

__Focus on Action and Adventure Genres__: It's advisable to give priority to producing more Action and Adventure films. These genres have consistently proven to be top earners within the industry. Audiences are drawn to thrilling, action-packed stories, making them a lucrative choice for filmmakers seeking profitability.

__Explore Drama and Documentary Productions__: In addition to Action and Adventure, consider exploring the production of drama and documentary films. These genres have a broad and enduring appeal within the industry and resonate well with both audiences and fellow filmmakers. Diversifying your portfolio with these genres can provide a stable and popular foundation.

Longer films often allow for deeper storytelling, character development, and immersive experiences. While brevity has its merits, especially in certain genres like comedy, prioritizing longer films can enhance their perceived value and appeal to paying audiences.

__Market Research and Audience Preferences__: Alongside these recommendations, conduct thorough market research to understand current audience preferences and industry trends. Stay attuned to what viewers are seeking, as this can inform your decisions regarding genres, film length, and overall production strategies.
